Caplena.com uses Augmented Intelligence to drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to analyze large amounts of free text from reviews or responses to open-ended questions. It all began when one of the co- founders, Maurice, won the prestigious SemEval competition for his Master Thesis. He began to explore ideas in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field with his colleague Pascal, a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in the field of Natural Language and Computer Vision. They soon realized a gap in the industry when Link and Success Drivers - two Market Research firms - inquired if the same technology could help them with open-ended survey coding. As it turned out, almost all firms that handle customer feedback face the same issue: too many open ends and not enough time to accurately analyze them all. Four months later, Pascal and Maurice had completed the first prototype - and things began to take off quickly. Since its inception in the spring of 2017, Caplena has doubled the number of text responses it processes every six months, with over 50M verbatims processed to date. Today Caplena serves companies in more than 15 countries.  From rapidly growing start-ups like Joyn to Fortune 500 companies like eBay & DHL - we have managed to achieve unparalleled customer loyalty. Building on that trust and keeping innovation at the core of everything we do, it is our mission to support any insight team that analyses any kind of open-ended feedback.",,"Analytics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Information Technology, Machine Learning, Market Research, Text Analytics","Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland",Caplena.com - The Fastest Way To Get Valuable Insights Out Of Open-Ended Customer Feedback,"27,378",2017-01-01,year,,"Maurice Gonzenbach, Pascal de Buren",Private,"28,046",,2024-07-10,4,Seed,3000000,EUR,3246936,Seed,5726715,USD,5726715,3000000,EUR,3246936,Seed,5716843,USD,5716843,"Venture Kick, Zürcher Kantonal Bank, Inveready, SICTIC, Spicehaus Partners",7,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Design, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",https://caplena.com/en/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/caplena/,info@caplena.com,11-50

Release Therapeutics,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/release-therapeutics,,1202,"Today, neurological conditions are the Number 1 cause of poor health, disability and premature death worldwide, impacting lives of all ages, lifestyles and backgrounds. Therapeutic proteins hold incredible potential in the treatment of these conditions, but their application is limited because the physical properties of proteins make it challenging for them to pass through the blood-brain barrier (a semi-permeable membrane that regulates the passage of large and small molecules into the brain tissue) and to reach their target sites.  At Release Tx, we are a preclinical-stage BioMedTech company developing the first cell macroencapsulation technology specifically designed to deliver diverse, potent therapeutic proteins beyond the human blood-brain barrier. We’re innovating at the nexus of biotech and MedTech with a cutting-edge, proprietary technology that consists of a versatile, implantable and biocompatible cell macroencapsulation device, no larger than a pin, and a genetically engineered cell line capable of producing a broad range of proteins for long-term delivery to the CNS and beyond. Our dedicated team brings together tremendous experience developing novel therapies from bench to bedside and has been instrumental in the evolution of this technology, from ideation to a potentially life-transforming reality.      Collaborating with the Paris Brain Institute, ranking 2nd in the world in the field of neurology research, and Minaris Regenerative Medicine, a leading CDMO with expertise in cell and gene therapies, we’ve demonstrated in animal models that our technology can reverse the progression of rare genetic diseases of the CNS. With two seminal publications by Cell Press journals in 2022 and 2023, we’ve made a major leap towards treating genetic diseases of the CNS without gene therapy, heralding a new era of hope for patients and their families around the world.",,"Biotechnology, Medical Device","Geneva, Geneve, Switzerland",Release Therapeutics is a biotechnology research company that gets therapeutic proteins where they are needed most in the CNS and beyond.,"37,266",2023-09-26,day,,,Private,"38,191",,2024-08-06,1,Seed,3300000,CHF,3855365,Seed,3300000,CHF,3855365,3300000,CHF,3855365,Seed,3300000,CHF,3855365,,,"Biotechnology, Health Care, Science and Engineering",,"Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",https://www.release-tx.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/releasetx/,contact@release-tx.com,1-10

The components produced are ""cast in one piece"", have highly complex 3D geometries and can be manufactured quickly and economically. By integrating ribs, different wall thicknesses or functional elements such as threads and fits, highly integral components are created which cannot be produced with conventional carbon manufacturing processes.

This can be a placement into a livestream on Twitch/YouTube or starting a TikTok challenge with hundreds of influencers at once.  Our precise matching engine based on genres, subgenres, moods & language enables artists or record labels to find the right influencers for promoting their music. On the other side, influencers get paid to place the music into their content and can therefore easily monetize their reach. Music is also way easier to integrate into content than regular product placements. At the same time, SongPush is cutting out the tiring process of inefficient back and forth negotiations via mail. Both parties involved profit from our fast and easy deal making process. Our data-driven platform analyzes all relevant campaign data to gain long-term insights about which music works best with which influencer and audience. For each successful cooperation between artist & influencer, SongPush charges a commission fee of ~25%.

A competitive benchmarking exercise, in the BEIS study, has confirmed that Suiso will have the lowest cost of H2 in a number of key H2 applications and lower Carbon emissions than grid powered electrolysis.  By producing Hydrogen at the point of use, Suiso eliminates the expensive distribution costs incurred by large scale centralised H2 producers, one of the primary obstacles to the widespread adoption of Hydrogen.  Suiso’s process reduces CO2 emissions by 97%+ versus steam methane reforming, utilizes 80% less energy than electrolysis and has very low equipment capital costs making it one of the most affordable Hydrogen production technologies.
