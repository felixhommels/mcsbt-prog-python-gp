Spotr.ai,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/octo,Growing,2596,"With an ever-growing population, climate change, and growing compliance obligations globally, real estate is eager for better solutions. Spotr.ai monitors and inspects over 250.000 buildings in the Netherlands and recently launched in the UK with 10 prominent UK housing corporations that will start inspecting their real estate portfolios with Spotr’s software solution. Spotr.ai offers a platform for banks, insurance companies, large real-estate owners, and the government to monitor building characteristics in a fast, precise, and easily accessible platform. This contributes to optimizing their client’s portfolios and activities. “It’s about knowing and understanding your portfolio.” Says Dirk Huibers, CEO at Spotr.ai. “Think of the dimensions, quantities, and conditions of buildings and their specific components. This information is crucial to make smart decisions when achieving sustainability goals. But it’s also about asking yourself the basic questions. On which buildings can you place external wall insulation? How many floors does a building have? Can you still reach that high floor with a fire truck? Are there trees close to the gutters that could cause water damage? You need accurate data to make the right decisions for your portfolio and wallet. And that data simply doesn’t exist today.”  With only 8% of buildings currently being inspected every year due to budget and time constraints of building owners and facility managers, there’s much to gain. “It’s our ambition to inspect every building in the world every year,” says Huibers. “In the largest global sector in the world, a small deviation can have a major impact on maintenance costs and valuations. Our smart software can make better, faster, and cheaper budget estimations than humans alone, which makes us a reliable and trustworthy partner.”",,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Big Data, Information Technology, Software","Den Haag, Zuid-Holland, The Netherlands","Inspects buildings automatically with Artificial Intelligence on satellites, airplanes, drones, cars and humans.","29,612",2015-01-01,year,,"Dirk Huibers, Marieke Dijksma, Tara Campagne",Private,"30,343",,2024-01-23,2,Early Stage Venture,4500000,EUR,4885898,Series A,7000000,EUR,7917303,4500000,EUR,4885898,Series A,7000000,EUR,7917303,"InnovationQuarter, Volta Ventures, Concrete Venture Capital, EDF Pulse Croissance",4,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data and Analytics, Information Technology, Science and Engineering, Software",,"European Union (EU), Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA)",http://spotr.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/company/octo/,marketing@spotr.ai,1-10

Mankind's future may very well depend on how we manage food production, energy, water and land use. Solar energy production can be a key factor in this balancing act but the land demand is very high. Hydroponic greenhouse agriculture can be a great asset, but its energy requirements are high. The ideal answer is a self-sufficient and sustainable greenhouse technology which eliminates the need for external energy sources.     Brite Solar is a nano-materials company that has developed a transparent solar glass technology based on Die Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC) . The first target market is greenhouse solar glass, which enables the greenhouse to generate electricity needed for sustaining the internal environment. Using this solar glass, the greenhouse's carbon footprint is significantly reduced as its reliance on externally generated electricity is significantly reduced or eliminated. This is a great value proposition for the greenhouse operator since it reduces the operating cost for the greenhouse by 28% which is currently the cost attributed to energy.  Brite's technology is based on nano-materials which are ink-jet printed on to glass panels, eliminating the expensive and complex production facilities needed to produce traditional solar panels.

Digitalization quickly accelerates energy consumption. In 2030, the ICT (Information and Communications Technology) sector is projected to stand for more than one-fifth of the global electricity demand. Maximizing performance per watt in servers and smart devices is critical to breaking the trend. ZeroPoint technology delivers up to 50% more performance per watt by removing unnecessary information from microchips in data centers (CPU) and smart devices (SoC), meaning that:  •	Data centers can maximize performance and reduce energy consumption.  •	Smart device developers can maximize performance and user experience without compromising on battery life. Typical memory contains up to 70% unnecessary information. ZeroPoint technology removes all this information by combining ultra-fast data compression with realtime data compaction and transparent memory management. Integrating these three areas into one solution for maximizing performance per watt makes us unique.  ZeroPoint is the result of decades of frontline research and in-depth technical knowledge. We have a strong patent portfolio and a pipeline of ideas related to our core business. ZeroPoint delivers a hardware IP block that customers integrate on their SoC.

We help our customers simplify the process of establishing a robust, end-to-end security architecture within the IoT and deliver efficiencies at scale through security automation. IoT brings new security challenges introduced by the scale and pace of adoption, as well as the physical consequences of compromised security. These challenges cannot be effectively addressed by traditional Information Technology (IT) security solutions. The Device Authority IoT security platform is purpose-built to address these challenges through automated device provisioning, credential management, secure updates and policy-driven data encryption. The IoT promises countless efficiencies, increased competitiveness, improved customer service and even brand new market opportunities. However, deploying strong security is hard and always has been. Deploying strong IoT security is even harder.  According to Gartner, by 2020, around 25% of all identified security breaches will involve IoT. To address this, Device Authority introduces a new paradigm of IoT Security Automation that accelerates and simplifies the deployment of strong IoT security. Advanced, policy driven security automation is critical for industrial, healthcare, transportation and other large scale security sensitive IoT environments.
